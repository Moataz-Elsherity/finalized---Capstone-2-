This capstone is the first capstone in the coursw with no guidance. 

#Background info
in this capstone we face a problem where cruella's is struggling to have multiple coats due to disney's financial struggle.
this makes it extremely import to maintain the condition of the coats she has which is only one coat thats black and white.
since the coat is poor quality one of the concerning factors when it comes to maintaining good condition is rain. 
since she has to walk around all year in disney looking down to her fans she needs to know if its going to rain so she can take necessary precautions.

#Fix/Goal
to build a classification machine learning model that predicts when it will rain at least 80% of the time. 
which we were able to achieve here.
